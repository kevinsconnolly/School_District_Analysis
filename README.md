Analysis:
The School District Analysis requested we replace the reading and math scores for 9th graders at the Thomas High School with "NAN" due to irregularities with their grades which is under the suspicion that academic dishonesty is in play. After changing the 9th grader's scores, we are prompted to answer a few questions in order to see the material changes due to the NAN of reading and math scores for 9th graders at the Thomas High School.

How is the district summary affected?
After updating the 9th grade NAN updatee: The average math score dropped from 79 to 78.9; the average reading score stayed the same; the passing math $ dropped from 75% to 74%; the passing reading % droped from 86% to 85% and the overall passing % dropped from 65% to 64%.

How is the school summmary affected?
After updating the 9th grade NAN update: The passing math % dropped from 93.27% 66.91%; the passing reading score dropped from 97.30% to 69.66% resulting in an overall passing % drop from 90.94% to 65.07%.This update places this medium school size school, Thomas High School, which was near the top of the peers is now in the bottom of its Medium size peers.

How does changing the reading and math scores for 9th graders at the Thomas High School affect their performance, relative to the other schools?
Before dropping the 9th grade reading and math, Thomas High School was the #2 overall performing school, below Cabrera High School and above Griffin High School. Unfortunately, after the 9th grade reading and math drop, Thomas High School fell to the middle of the pack; just below Holden High School. Furthermore, it dropped to the bottom of all Charter Schools. 

Now that we changed the reading and math scores for 9th graders at the Thomas High School, I can answer the bottom 4 key questions:
 1) After replacing the ninth grade math scores with Nan, it went from 83% average math score to NaN.
 2) Scores by School Spending dropped in the $630 - $644 range from Passing Math going from 93.27% down to 66.91% and Passing reading dropping from 97.3% down to 69.66% which          represents a sharp drop down.
 3) Scores by Schools Size: Thomas High School is in the Medium School size of (1000-2000) and
     The Passing Math for Medium School Size (1000 - 2000) dropped from 94% down
     to 88% and the passing Reading for Medium School size (1000 - 2000) dropped from 97% down to 91%
 4) Concerning School Type: the District score's were unchanged but the Charter Schools expereienced a passing math drop of from 94% to 93% and a drop in passing reading from 97%      to 93% due to Thomas high School being a Charter School.
